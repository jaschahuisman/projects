Based on the type of room, Twindle interprets the data for different use cases so that the user can act on it, for example: 'At 4:00 pm, guests arrive in room 124, where it is currently too cold. Turn up the heating', or 'The door of toilet 16 has already been used 34 times today, check the toilet for an early clean.'</p>"

During my internship at Handpicked Labs I was responsible for the backend communication between the LoraWan IoT network, the database server and the front-end. I also built the front-end application with WebGL integration in React.js.'</p>"
